# Reference finder test data

The reference finder test system tests the code that finds references to classes.

Each test has a Java file and a text file. The Java file should be named `[test name].java`.
The text file should be named `[test name].txt`.

The text file should contain a list of class names, one per line, that the accompanying code
refers to.
